### 🚀 Quick Start :

#### Clone / Forked Repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/readloud.github.io
```

#### Creating a new branch (IMP)

```bash
$ git branch <name_of_branch>
$ git checkout -b <name_of_branch>
```

Keep your cloned repo up-to date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)

```bash
git pull origin main
```

#### Contribute

Make relevant changes according to the issue that you were assigned on. Contribute in any way you feel like :) 

#### Committing and Pushing

Once you have modified an existing file or added a new file to the project, you can add it to your local repository, which we can do with the git add command.

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -m "useful commit message"
```

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```
