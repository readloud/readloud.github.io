    <h1 id="hashcat-pssw0rd-cracking-basic-usage">Hashcat P@ssw0rd Cracking: Basic Usage"</h1>
<p>The core syntax of hashcat is as follows:
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-0-1"><a id="__codelineno-0-1" name="__codelineno-0-1" href="#__codelineno-0-1"></a>hashcat -a &lt;$attack mode&gt; -m &lt;$hash_algorithm&gt; &lt;$hash (stdin/file)&gt; &lt;$dictionary&gt;
</span></code></pre></div>
<code>$hash</code> and <code>$dictionary</code> are your target hashes and <code>dictionary/wordlist</code> file. We‚Äôll touch on the other parts below.</p>
<h2 id="hashing-algorithms">Hashing Algorithms</h2>
<p>This is the type of hash you‚Äôre trying to crack. Hashcat supports hundreds of hashes and the chosen hash mode needs to be stated for hashcat to know what to attack. The modes can be found using <code>hashcat ‚Äê‚Äêhelp</code> (note: hashcat cannot attack multiple hash types in a single session but there are other tools that can). Recent versions of hashcat also support hash auto-detection if <code>-m &lt;$mode&gt;</code> isn‚Äôt passed, however as several hash types are constructed similarly, false positives can occur and therefore it isn‚Äôt encouraged.</p>
<p>For example, <code>MD5 would be -m 0</code>, <code>SHA1 would be -m 100</code> and so on.</p>
<h2 id="attack-modes">Attack Modes</h2>
<p>This is the type of password attack you‚Äôd like to carry out. Dictionary (referred to as <code>Straight</code> in hashcat) is <code>attack mode 0</code>. This is also the default attack type and doesn‚Äôt need to be explicitly added if a dictionary attack is being performed. Hashcat‚Äôs supported attack modes are shown below and again can also be found by using <code>hashcat ‚Äê‚Äêhelp</code>. This post is only going to cover dictionary attacks, however, future guides might address more.</p>
<p>So now we‚Äôve got an idea of the basic syntactical construction, let‚Äôs crack some hashes.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre going to use the <code>(arguably)</code> most well known dictionary available, <code>rockyou.txt</code> (available from <code>https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords</code> amongst other places). It contains <code>circa 14.5 million passwords</code>, was derived from <code>real</code> passwords and has shown to be very successful for several years. In the below example we‚Äôre going to crack an <code>MD5</code> hash.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-1-1"><a id="__codelineno-1-1" name="__codelineno-1-1" href="#__codelineno-1-1"></a>hashcat -m 0 42f749ade7f9e195bf475f37a44cafcb ..\wordlists\rockyou.txt
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After you kick off the session, you can get status updates by pressing ‚Äòs‚Äô which will show you speed of attack, ETA for completion and a number of other things. If you‚Äôre attacking multiple hashes in a file, cracked ones will be displayed on screen in real time as they‚Äôre cracked.</p>
<p>In the above example, the clear text password of <code>Password123</code> was in the rockyou.txt list so it was successfully cracked.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôve cracked several hashes from a file, you can run <code>hashcat -m &lt;$hash_algorithm&gt; &lt;$hash_file&gt;</code> ‚Äê‚Äêshow at the end of the session to see all your results.</p>
<p>You might also have usernames with your hashes and hashcat supports this in a <code>username:hash</code> format So you can match the usernames back to the cracked hashes at the end, make sure you run <code>‚Äê‚Äêusername</code> when you start cracking, and similarly, <code>‚Äê‚Äêusername ‚Äê‚Äêshow</code> to retrieve them at the end.
Increasing Success with Rules</p>
<h2 id="what-if-the-password-isnt-in-your-dictionary">What if the password isn‚Äôt in your dictionary?</h2>
<p>Rules do things like substituting letters for numbers, adding a special character at the end etc. that we as society have done for years in the belief it makes our passwords stronger and less guessable.</p>
<p>For example, if the clear text password is <code>P@ssword</code> and your dictionary contains Password, it wouldn‚Äôt crack. However if a rule set has been applied that tells hashcat to try replacing a with <code>@</code> every time it sees it then we‚Äôll get a hit.</p>
<p>Rules, although optional, significantly increase your chances of success and they‚Äôre generally worth using in most situations. Hashcat comes shipped with a several rulesets. Below is an excerpt of one of these rules called <code>best64.rule</code>. We‚Äôre not going to cover how these rule sets are constructed, but in the lower section we can see hashcat will try appending a number to the end of each candidate in our dictionary.</p>
<p>For very fast hashes like <code>MD5, NTLM, SHA1</code>, I also created a rule called OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule that works quite well. A streamlined/updated version of this is in the pipeline!</p>
<p>You can use <code>‚Äê‚Äêrules</code> or <code>-r</code> to tell hashcat to use a rule file, e.g. <code>hashcat -m 0 &lt;$hash/file&gt; rockyou.txt -r rules\OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule</code></p>
<h2 id="basic-troubleshooting">Basic Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Hashcat might give errors when running, and although we can‚Äôt cover them all (many are <code>hardware/driver/runtime</code> related), some basic errors and what they might mean are provided below.</p>
<ol>
<li>In this example, the file pwned_hashes.txt doesn‚Äôt exist in the specified location (hashcat‚Äôs own folder by default). Check the file path of your hash list.</li>
<li>Your dictionary doesn‚Äôt exist in the specified location. Check the file path.</li>
<li>
<p>If the hashes are displayed on screen in the error then it could be a few things:</p>
<p>You‚Äôve supplied the wrong hash mode (in this instance those were MD5 hashes but <code>-m100</code> was supplied which is SHA1).
We can see that the hash file contains usernames at the start, however ‚Äê‚Äêusername might not have been supplied.
Your hash file contains special characters that aren‚Äôt expected for the algorithm you‚Äôve selected, e.g. a bcrypt hash would contain special characters, however an MD5 would not. Check the expected format of your hashes with, for exmaple, <code>hashcat.exe -m3200 ‚Äê‚Äêexample-hash</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
