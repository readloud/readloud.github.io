<p>Before jumping to the real bug bounties engagements you might need some web targets that have been made intentionally vulnerable, 
there are many CTF platforms offering 24/7 web targets:--- </p>
<h3 id="start-now">Start Now</h3>
<p>Now after discussing many topics and tools, this is the right time to talk about the bug bounty platform itself here is a list of the well known platforms that offer many programs.</p>
<p>=&gt; <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/">HackerOne</a> -:  world's largest community of hackers and bug hunters </p>
<p>=&gt; <a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/">Bugcrowd</a> -: powerful bug bounty platform and team of security researchers, one of the best platforms that connects organizations with ethical hackers .</p>
<p>=&gt; <a href="https://www.intigriti.com/">Intigriti</a> -: Europe's biggest community of security researchers that help companies to protect their assets</p>
<p>=&gt; <a href="https://www.synack.com/">Synack</a> -: American intelligence platform automates the discovery of vulnerable endpoints &amp; assets .</p>
<p>=&gt; <a href="https://www.yeswehack.com/">YesWeHack</a> -: Bug Bounty protects applications the agile way with a wide community of white hackers using private and public programs.</p>
<p>=&gt; <a href="https://hackenproof.com/">HackenProof</a> -: vulnerability coordination platform , connects companies with the global security researchers community to uncover any security issues .
After understanding these vulnerabilities you can begin reading others reports ,POCs on the bug bounty platforms to figure out the common testing techniques</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-hunting-bugs">Introduction to Hunting Bugs</h2>
<p>Firstly Why do we learn to hunt bugs?</p>
<ul>
<li>It is difficult to answer this question in one sentence. The first and foremost reason is we want to be better security proffessional or researchers.
    When a security proffessional is able to hunt security bugs in any web application, it gains them recognition, and because they are helping the whole 
    community to remain safe and secure, it earns them respect as well as monetary benefits which we call Bounty.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug-bounty-platforms">Bug Bounty Platforms</h3>
<ul>
<li>As a beginner one should try the bug bounty platforms first and stick around for a long time to earn the tricks and techniques.
    In reality, not only beginners but many experienced security proffessionals are attached to such platforms and regularly hack for them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-do-i-get-started">How do I get started?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Here’s a curated list of resources:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Programming</strong></p>
<p><em>Programming is an important part of being a successful hacker. This isn’t a comprehensive list of programming languages and nearly any can be used for most hacking tasks, especially on the web, but rather a list of languages we find especially useful or notable.</em></p>
<p>=&gt; JavaScript: This is the language used on the majority of web pages. Understanding it is useful for bug hunting because many bugs actually stem from JS code.
   =&gt; Python: Commonly used for automating various activities during testing, as well as being useful for general programming.
   =&gt; SQL: Used by most applications for accessing and manipulating data. Knowledge of SQL will help in discovering and exploiting critical SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
   =&gt; Python and Ruby: Useful for automation and quick testing and analysis, particularly for web hacking.
   =&gt; JavaScript: Can be used for the same tasks as Python and Ruby (albeit with fewer relevant libraries), but mostly useful to know for analysis of code on the web, 
      as well as  exploitation.
   =&gt; Objective-C and Swift: The ability to read these will be essential if you plan to do source code review of iOS applications.
   =&gt; Java and Kotlin: The ability to read these will be essential if you plan to do source code review of Android applications. Java is produced by decompilers for 
      Android applications, which allows you to read code (roughly) equivalent to the original source, even when you only have a compiled application.
   =&gt; AArch64 assembly: For advanced embedded and mobile hacking, understanding the very lowest level of abstraction is essential.</p>
<p><strong>Networking</strong></p>
<p>=&gt; Terminology guide: You’ll hear many terms from IP address to port to DNS. This guide will help you understand that.
   =&gt; Common Port Numbers: A useful list of common port numbers and the associated services.</p>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<p>=&gt; Setting up your own web server: While not security-related in itself, this will teach you many of the commands and concepts you need to know to become a great hacker.
  =&gt; Setting up Kali Linux on Virtualbox: Kali is a hacking-oriented Linux distribution, used by many bug hunters. This guide will help you set it up in a virtual machine.
  =&gt; Command Line Guide: You’ll end up using many command-line tools as a hacker, so a familiarity with its structure and use is valuable.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p><strong>Before finding bugs in any platforms you need to understand how web applications work and understanding the architecture of these apps.</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>You need to know how to use the Virtual Machine and Kali Linux</li>
<li>Solid understanding of some network fundamentals ,SQL database , web components like HTML, CSS, php and Javascript will increase the opportunity of<br />
     analysing some vulnerabilities but you shouldn't be an expert for all of them.</li>
<li>Also if you have some knowledge in python , it will be an added value to create your own tools that will help you to achieve a specific goal that other
     tools won’t do it for you.</li>
<li>Some of the key areas to focus that are part of OWASP Top 10 which are:<ul>
<li>Information gathering</li>
<li>SQL Injection</li>
<li>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</li>
<li>Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</li>
<li>Local &amp; Remote file inclusion </li>
<li>Information Disclosure </li>
<li>Remote Code execution (RCE) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You must learn to operate tools like:<ul>
<li>Burpsuite</li>
<li>OWASP ZAP</li>
<li>WebGoat</li>
<li>Web Browser</li>
<li>Proxy</li>
<li>Virtual Machine</li>
<li>Virtual Lab</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2 id="setting-up-your-environment">Setting up your Environment</h2>
<p>====&gt; To start with tools like <em>BurpSuite, OWASP ZAP, WebGoat,</em> you need to install Kali Linux in your Virtual Machine. We will do that for one reason: 
      Kali Linux comes up with all these tools by default. Therefore you don't have to install them separately.</p>
<p>====&gt; A virtual machine, or virtualisation, is not mandatory for the experienced Ethical Hacker. As an experienced Ethical Hacker, you can run 
      Kali Linux as your main system and perform the hacking using mainly a terminal with the help of a programming language such as Python, 
      or we can use selected tools like Metasploit.</p>
<p>As an aspiring Ethical Hacker and penetration tester, you should become capable of building Virtual and Physical Labs to use it for practice </p>
<p><strong>Why do we need Virtual Environment?</strong>
    - Virtualisation is very important for any type of penetration testing. You are going to learn how to find security vulnerabilites in any web application,
      and that needs a lot of practice before you actually approach a client to do the same on their live system. So we need a simulated environment first, 
      a network security lab where we can practice, to learn and understand every trick of hunting bugs so that we can impliment them on the live applications 
      later as secuurity proffessionals.</p>
<p>Introduction to Kali Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the VirtualBox has been installed on your machine,</li>
<li>you need not worry about installing several operating systems on it.</li>
<li>Firstly, we need to install Kali Linux on our VirtualBox.</li>
<li>Go to the official Kali Linux and download the ISO image of the latest stable version.</li>
<li>Kali Linux is a much bigger Linux distribution than other Linux distributions.</li>

<h3 id="injection-request-forgery">Injection Request Forgery</h3>
<p><strong>What is Cross-Site Request Forgery?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated.
   --- In CSRF, an attacker tricks the browser into doing some unwanted action in a web application to which a user is logged in.
       Therefore the user is also tricked because they do not know what is happening behind the curtain.
       They log into their bank account and get a session ticket. 
       The attacker uses the same session ticket and transfers the funds into his account.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For this session CSRF is also known as season riding or sea surfing</em></p>

<h3 id="exploiting-through-cross-site-scriptingxss">Exploiting through Cross-Site Scripting(XSS)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Resisting Cross-Site Scripting(XSS) is one of the most daunting tasks; web applications usually have many types of vulnerabilites that trigger XSS
   atacks. </li>
<li>It is one of the most common attacks, and it is always featuredin the top ten IT security risks.</li>
<li>The bigger the web application, the harder is the task to resist XSS.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="discovering-xss-vulnerabilities">Discovering XSS vulnerabilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Discovering any XSS attack in a web application has been made easy through Burp Suite. </li>
<li>We can easily discover whether a web application has vulnerabilities or not.</li>
<li>We can also discover whether it has already been attacked by someone or not just by attacking it using Burp Suite.</li>
</ul>
<p>===&gt; TO DO THIS - we can install OWASP blocking web application</p>
<h3 id="header-injection-and-url-redirection">Header Injection and URL Redirection</h3>
<ul>
<li>Header Injection and URL Redirection are possible when a web application accepts unvalidated user inputs, these untrusted data may redirect the page to a malicious website.</li>

<p><strong>Cross-Site Scripting through Header Injection</strong></p>
<p>-- So far we have learned that open redirections or URL redirections are potential vulnerabilities for any web application. 
     Under the influence of untrusted user input data, any web application may fall into this phishing trap. 
     In such cases, a redirection is performed to a location specified in user-supplied data.
  -- OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite is used here to perform the task </p>
<h3 id="malicious-files">Malicious Files</h3>
<ul>
<li>Uploaded malicious files always pose a great threat to web applications. </li>
<li>An attacker tries to upload code to the system to be attacked ; later that code is supposed to be executed.</li>
<li>Usually the "attack" only needs to be find a way to get the code executed to own the system</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Uploading Malicious Files to Own a system</strong>
   - The file upload_module needs a "file upload form". This form could easily be a major security risk because, 
     if it is done without a full understanding of the risks associated with it, it might open the doors for the server compromise. 
     However, despite the security concerns, you cannot imagine a web application without a file-upload module.
     It is one of the most common requirements. </p>

<li>Sender POlicy Framework is a technical standard that helps protect email senders and recipients from spam, spoofing and phishing.</li>
<li>It's a form of email authentication.</li>
<li>SPF can be defined as a way to validate that an email message is sent from an authorized mail server.</li>
<li>In order to detect forgery and to detect spam, it is mandatory for every web application.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Testing SPF Records</strong>
  - It specifically identifies which mail servers are permitted to send email on behalf of your domain, using IP addresses.
  - In any case the SPF record is included in an organization's DNS database as a specially formatted DNS text record.
  - There are simple steps that can help you write the SPF entries for your clients.</p>
<p>==&gt;  - The first step is to impliment SPF is to identify who is the email servers, each one to use to send email from your domains
       - make a list of your sending domains

<p><strong>Injecting Unintended XML</strong>
   - Whenever we pen test an application and we see that the application functionality has XML parsing in the backend, we try to pen test the app with 
     XML injection issues. 
   - Usually we use an XML parser to check whether the client application's XML documents is properly formatted or not
   - We also validate the XML documents with that XML parser
   - Before pentesting in an aplication with XML injection issue, we examine injection using XML parser is a normal procedure.A type of XML injection can cause medium to severe 
     kind of damages to the application. It can alter the intended logic of the application, ie, why we call it unintended XML injection</p>
<p><strong>what is XML?</strong>
   -- XML is a software and hardware independent language for storing and transporting data 
   -- It stands for Extensible Markup Language and is similar to HTML.
   -- XML was designed to be self-descriptive.

<h1 id="bug-bounty-beginners-roadmap">Bug Bounty Beginner's Roadmap</h1>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> The bug bounty landscape has changed since the last few years. The issues we used to find easily an year ago would not be easy now. 
Automation is being used rigorously and most of the "<em>low hanging fruits</em>" are being duplicated if you are out of luck. 
If you want to start doing bug bounty, you will have to be determined to be consistent and focused, as the competition is very high.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is a bug?</strong><ul>
<li>Security bug or vulnerability is “a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, OR availability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What is Bug Bounty?</strong><ul>
<li>A bug bounty or bug bounty  program is IT jargon for a reward or bounty program given for finding and reporting a bug in a particular software product. Many IT companies offer bug bounties to drive product improvement and get more interaction from end users or clients. Companies that operate bug bounty  programs may get hundreds of bug reports, including security bugs and security vulnerabilities, and many who report those bugs stand to receive awards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What is the Reward?</strong><ul>
<li>There are all types of rewards based on the severity of  the issue and the cost to fix. They may range from real money (most prevalent) to premium subscriptions (Prime/Netflix), discount coupons (for e commerce of shopping sites), gift vouchers, swags (apparels, badges, customized stationery, etc.). <em>Money may range from 50$ to 50,000$ and even more.</em></li>

<h3 id="some-additional-tips">Some additional Tips</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don't do bug bounty as a full time</strong> in the beginning (although I suggest don't do it full time at any point). There is no guarantee to get bugs every other day, there is no stability. Always keep multiple sources of income (bug bounty not being the primary).</li>
<li><strong>Stay updated</strong>, learning should never stop. Join twitter, follow good people, maintain the curiosity to learn something new every day. Read writeups, blogs and keep expanding your knowledge.</li>
<li>Always see <strong>bug bounty as a medium to enhance your skills</strong>. Money will come only after you have the skills. Take money as a motivation only.</li>
<li><strong>Don't be dependent on automation</strong>. You can't expect a tool to generate money for you. Automation is everywhere. The key to success in Bug Bounty is to be unique. Build your own methodology, learn from others and apply on your own. </li>
<li>Always try to escalate the severity of the bug, <strong>keep a broader mindset</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Stay connected to the community</strong>. Learn and contribute. There is always someone better than you in something. don't miss an opportunity to network. Join forums, go to conferences and hacking events, meet people, learn from their experiences. </li>
<li><strong>Always be helpful</strong>.</li>
</ol>
